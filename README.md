## YouTube QA Assistant

A project that utilizes OpenAI's capabilities to analyze YouTube videos and answer user-submitted questions about their content.

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the integration of natural language processing tools and AI models to extract insights and knowledge from YouTube videos. Key functionalities:

*   Processes YouTube videos based on provided URLs.
*   Leverages OpenAI embeddings to create vector representations of video content for semantic analysis.
*   Employs OpenAI's language models to answer questions related to the video content in a concise and informative manner.

**Technologies Used**

*   **OpenAI API:**  Provides access to powerful language models and embeddings for text generation and semantic analysis.
*   **React:** Serves as the frontend framework.
*   **Next.js:** Employed for server-side API routes.
*   **LangChain.js** (Optional): Used to structure chains for working with the OpenAI API and document loaders.

**Setup**

1.  **Prerequisites**
    *   Node.js and npm or yarn
    *   An OpenAI API key (obtainable from your OpenAI dashboard)
2.  **Installation**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name> 
    cd <your-repo-name>
    npm install      # Or yarn install
    ``` 
3.  **Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key 
    ```
4.  **Start the Project**
    ```bash
    npm run dev      # Or yarn dev
    ```

**Usage**

1. Navigate to the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter a YouTube video URL.
3. Ask a question related to the video's content.
4. Get your answer! 

**Credits**

This project was developed as part of the "[Course Title]" course on Frontend Masters by Scott Moss.

**Disclaimer**

This project is for learning and demonstration purposes. The accuracy and reliability of answers generated by the AI models depend on the quality of the YouTube video and the relevance of the provided questions.

**Future Improvements**

*   Implement a more robust UI with better input validation and enhanced UX.
*   Explore alternative vector stores to improve efficiency and scalability.
*   Add error handling and provide more informative feedback to the user.

I hope this README provides a clear overview of your project! Feel free to customize and add more details as needed.
